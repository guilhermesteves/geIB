# App

This package contains everything organized by these simple packages:

## Actions

Contains all the actions (and annotations) for Controllers

## Controllers

Well, guess what? The logic must come from somewhere

## Models

Here is where the magic really happens, baby

## Services

Anything concerning integrations, external communication and services in general

## Utils

Behold the black sheep of the family, when something doesn't belong anywhere, it belongs here

## Views

It should have all the application views, but I'm going to use it to store email templates only. We wont be making any front-end in this project


### Global.java
