# Tokumei Kokoro - 匿名心

A different approach to a ImageBoard

After being frustrated with [Kusaba](http://kusabax.cultnet.net) and [Tinyboard](https://github.com/savetheinternet/Tinyboard), I realized I need to do my own API to an ImageBoard software.

I really believe we can have a healthy and sane community of anonymous sharing ideas, that's why I chose this name.
